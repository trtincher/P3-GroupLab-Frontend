        As a software engineer with a background in non-profit management and the performing arts, I bring perspective and passion to each project I approach. My work in labor relations and remote team management has measurably improved workplace satisfaction and productivity, and my work as a professional musician demonstrates my uncompromising commitment to producing polished, professional products on a tight deadline.

        On Forte, I spearheaded the backend development and deployment to Heroku and MongoDB Atlas. I then worked on the logic to show student matches and connections between teachers and students.

        I'm a software engineer who builds user forward websites that integrate function and design! I have a diverse background in philosophy, theology, art and beer, which has sharpened my analytical mind, given me an eye for aesthetic, and a drive towards productivity.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I work as the team coordinator, GitHub gatekeeper, and occasional troubleshooter. My primary contributions were: to develop overarching frameworks and file structures; maintain smooth task delegation and work flow; and to help problem solve with the SignUp component and EditProfile component.

        I'm a software engineer incorporating a decade of experience in creative media-production roles into my  web-design projects. My goal is to build products that make music and art education more accessible to people around the world.

        I got the idea for Forte while working on a previous project, and this talented, hardworking team has made it into a reality. For my role, I developed the concept, the wireframes and UX, and built the Login, Sign-Up, About, StudentForm, TeacherForm, and Meet the Team components. Additionally, I was responsible for leading the styling of the project, and ensuring the aesthetic continuity of the user interface upon deployment.

        I'm a software developer with a background in customer success and accounting. From my experiences onboarding new customers in my previous role, I've cultivated a passion for improving user experience. As a developer, my goal is to solve customer pain points through software.

        In this MERN app I mainly focused on the front-end and one front-end concerning part of the back-end (CORS). These are the components I created: Dashboard, Profile, Delete Profile, Edit Profile, Landing, and App.js. I also set up our basic React app and deployed on Surge. Profile and Dashboard were the most rewarding components I worked on. I'm proud of all the code I wrote and of the Forte team!
